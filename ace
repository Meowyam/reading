ace: attempto controlled english
- desigend to write specifications
• to support the writing of precise specifications,
• to reduce ambiguity and vagueness inherent in full natural language,
• to encourage domain specialists to deliberately choose a clear and unambiguous writing
style so that readers of a specification understand it in the same way as the writer,
• to make specifications computer processable,
• to render specifications unambiguously translatable into formal specification languages,
particularly into first-order logic,
• to make specifications executable.

content words (user-defined, domain-specific). use lexical editor to define or import lexicon

function words: predefined (conjunctions etc.)

composite sentences built from simple sentences with:
and/or

If verbs are negated as in
A customer does not insert a card and a code.
the negated verb will be inserted to yield the paraphrase
A customer does not insert a card and [does not insert] a code

commas override binding order
A customer inserts a VisaCard or a MasterCard, and a code.
means that the customer inserts a VisaCard and a code or a MasterCard and a code.

there's subordination (relative sentences: who/which/theat, and if-then)

there's quantification
ace no passive voice
"for every *** there is **"

there's negation


~ queries ~
yes/no
query words: who/which/what/how/when
-- cannot query the verb

~~ constraining ambiguity ~~
repeat 'that'

prepositional phrase always modifies verb:
The customer inserts a card with a code.
we get the paraphrase
The customer {inserts a card with a code}

to clarify use 'that' for (card that has code) or 'and', for custoemr inserts card AND a code

anaphoric references: use 'the' or pronouns ('it')
pronouns /articles replaced with most recent accessible noun phrase that agrees with gender & number

~~ each ace sentence has truth value ~~

verbs: events or states
textual order is temporal order

can only detect explicit logical contradictions, eg.
cat is grey
cat is not grey ==> contradiction
BUT
cat is grey
cat is white, have to define that:
every cat that is grey is not white
